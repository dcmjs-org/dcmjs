## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added Adapters and Utilities to support translation between common imaging toolkits (Cornerstone, VTK.js) and DICOM Structured Reports. Utilities are tied to the DICOM Standard and help build compliant files. Adapters are specific to the toolkits in question and help make it easier for developers to use the Utilities.

Note: These are generally still a work in progress. We are currently only confident in the Cornerstone Length adapter, and the Utilities (TID1500, TID1501, TID300, Length) which back it.
