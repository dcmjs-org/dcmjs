**Note: this code is a work-in-progress and should not be used for production or clinical purposes**

See [live examples here](https://dcmjs.netlify.com/)

# Goals

_Overall the code should:_

- Support reading and writing of correct DICOM objects in JavaScript for browser or node environments
- Provide a programmer-friendly JavaScript environment for using and manipulating DICOM objects
- Include a set of useful demos to encourage correct usage of dcmjs and modern DICOM objects
- Encourage correct referencing of instances and composite context when creating derived objects
- Current target is modern web browsers, but a set of node-based utilities also makes sense someday

_Architectural goals include:_

- Use modern JavaScript programming methods (currently ES6) but avoid heavy frameworks
- Leverage modern DICOM standards but avoid legacy parts
- Support straightforward integration with multiple JavaScript deployment targets (browser, node, etc) and frameworks.

_Parts of DICOM that dcmjs will focus on:_

- Enhanced Multiframe Images
- Segmentation Objects
- Parametric Maps
- Structured Reports

_Parts of DICOM that dcmjs *will not* focus on:_

- DIMSE (legacy networking like C-FIND, C-MOVE, etc)
- Physical Media (optical disks)

# Usage

// To install latest _stable_ release
npm install --save dcmjs

// To install latest code merged to master
npm install --save dcmjs@dev
```

## For Developers

```None

# Status

Currently dcmjs is an early-stage development experiment, but already has valuable functionality.

## Implemented

- Bidirectional conversion to and from part 10 binary DICOM and DICOM standard JSON encoding (as in [DICOMweb](http://dicomweb.org))
- Bidirectional convertion to and from DICOM standard JSON and a programmer-friendly high-level version (high-level form is called the "naturalized" form in the code).

## In development

- Creation of (correct) enhanced multiframe DICOM objects from legacy image objects
- Creation of (correct) derived DICOM objects such as Segmentations and Structured Reports

## TODO

- Create a test suite of input and output DICOM objects
- Test interoperability with other DICOM implementations
- Add documentation

# History

- 2014
  - [DCMTK](dcmtk.org) cross compiled to javascript at [CTK Hackfest](http://www.commontk.org/index.php/CTK-Hackfest-May-2014). While this was useful and powerful, it was heavyweight for typical web usage.
- 2016
  - A [Medical Imaging Web Appliction meeting at Stanford](http://qiicr.org/web/outreach/Medical-Imaging-Web-Apps/) and [follow-on hackfest in Boston](http://qiicr.org/web/outreach/MIWS-hackfest/) helped elaborate the needs for manipulating DICOM in pure Javascript.
  - Based on [DICOM Part 10 read/write code](https://github.com/OHIF/dicom-dimse) initiated by Weiwei Wu of [OHIF](http://ohif.org), Steve Pieper [developed further features](https://github.com/pieper/sites/tree/gh-pages/dcmio) and [examples of creating multiframe and segmentation objects](https://github.com/pieper/sites/tree/gh-pages/DICOMzero) discussed with the community at RSNA
- 2017
  - At [NA-MIC Project Week 25](https://na-mic.org/wiki/Project_Week_25) Erik Ziegler and Steve Pieper [worked](https://na-mic.org/wiki/Project_Week_25/DICOM_Segmentation_Support_for_Cornerstone_and_OHIF_Viewer)
    with the community to define some example use cases to mix the pure JavaScript DICOM code with Cornerstone and [CornerstoneTools](https://github.com/chafey/cornerstoneTools).
- 2018-2020
  - Work continues to develop SR and SEG support to [OHIFViewer](http://ohif.org) allow interoperability with [DICOM4QI](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/qiicr/dicom4qi/details)
